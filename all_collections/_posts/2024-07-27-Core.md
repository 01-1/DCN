# DCN Interaction Bonuses

DCN will implement a dynamic reward system that incentivizes user engagement and content creation using CORE tokens.

- Engagement Rewards: Users will earn CORE tokens for various activities such as posting content, commenting, liking, sharing, and participating in discussions. The more active a user is, the more they will be rewarded.

- Content Creation: High-quality content that receives significant interaction (likes, shares, comments) will be eligible for additional rewards. This will encourage users to produce valuable and engaging content.

- Community Contributions: Users who contribute to the community in meaningful ways, such as moderating discussions, creating tutorials, or helping others, can receive special recognition and rewards.

- Event Participation: Special events, challenges, and competitions will be regularly organized within the platform, offering additional opportunities for users to earn CORE tokens.

All rewards will be issued in CORE tokens, which can be used within the platform for various purposes, such as purchasing premium features, tipping other users, boosting posts to user feeds, or participating in governance.

# DCN's Governance Model

DCN adopts a decentralized governance model to ensure that the community has a significant role in shaping the platform's future. The governance framework includes the following components:

- Decentralized Voting: Major decisions regarding platform policies, feature development, and other critical aspects are made through decentralized voting.

- Proposals and Discussions: Any user can submit proposals for changes or improvements to the platform. These proposals are open for discussion, allowing the community to debate and refine ideas before they go to a vote.

- Elected Representatives: Users can elect representatives to oversee specific aspects of platform governance. These representatives are accountable to the community and can be replaced through elections if they fail to meet expectations.

- Transparency and Accountability: All governance activities, including voting results, proposal discussions, and representative actions, are transparent and publicly accessible. This ensures accountability and builds trust within the community.

- Incentivized Participation: Active participation in governance is rewarded. Users who vote, propose, and engage in discussions earn additional CORE tokens, encouraging a vibrant and engaged community. CORE tokens can also be used to boost discussions to the user feed, allowing more eyes to see your proposal.

Through these mechanisms, DCN ensures that the platform remains community-driven, transparent, and adaptive to the needs and desires of its users. By combining decentralized technology with innovative governance and reward systems, DCN aims to create a thriving, equitable, and dynamic social network on Core Chain.
