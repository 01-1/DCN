# Proposal Summary:
This proposal outlines the implementation of a reward distribution system for the DCN: Decentralized Core Network. CORE funds will be sourced from user-run boosts (ads) and sent to a dedicated smart contract. These funds will be redistributed to users based on engagement and interaction, participation in governance, and moderation efforts.

# Proposal Details:

## 1. **Funding Source:**
   - CORE tokens for rewards will be acquired through user-run boosts (ads) on the platform. Users and advertisers can promote their content by purchasing boosts, with payments made in CORE tokens.
   - The funds collected from these boosts will be directed to a secure smart contract designed for reward distribution.

## 2. **Reward Distribution Mechanism:**
   - **Engagement and Interaction Rewards:**
     - Users will earn CORE tokens for activities such as posting content, commenting, liking, sharing, and participating in discussions.
     - A weighted system will be implemented to ensure that high-quality and popular content receives more rewards.
   - **Governance Participation Rewards:**
     - Users who actively participate in governance activities, such as voting on proposals, submitting proposals, and engaging in governance discussions, will earn additional CORE tokens.
     - This incentivizes active involvement in the decision-making process and ensures a vibrant and engaged community.
   - **Moderation Rewards:**
     - Users who contribute to the platform's health and safety by moderating content, reporting violations, and assisting in dispute resolution will receive CORE tokens.
     - Moderators play a crucial role in maintaining the community standards and ensuring a positive user experience.

## 3. **Smart Contract Specifications:**
   - A dedicated smart contract will be developed to manage the distribution of CORE rewards.
   - The contract will transparently allocate funds based on predefined criteria for engagement, governance participation, and moderation.
   - Regular audits and community oversight will ensure the integrity and fairness of the distribution process.

## 4. **Implementation Timeline:**
   - **Phase 1: Design and Development (Month 1-2)**
     - Design the smart contract and reward distribution algorithm.
     - Develop the smart contract and integrate it with the DCN platform.
   - **Phase 2: Testing and Optimization (Month 3)**
     - Conduct thorough testing to ensure the smart contract functions as intended.
     - Optimize the reward distribution criteria based on user feedback.
   - **Phase 3: Deployment and Launch (Month 4)**
     - Deploy the smart contract on Core Chain.
     - Launch the reward distribution system and start issuing rewards to users.

## 5. **Expected Outcomes:**
   - Increased user engagement and interaction on the DCN platform.
   - Enhanced participation in governance, leading to a more community-driven platform.
   - Improved content moderation, resulting in a safer and more enjoyable user experience.

## 6. **Evaluation and Adjustments:**
   - The reward distribution system will be monitored continuously, and regular reports will be provided to the community.
   - Based on community feedback and data analysis, adjustments will be made to ensure the system remains fair, effective, and aligned with the platform's goals.

# Conclusion:
Implementing a CORE rewards distribution mechanism will significantly enhance user engagement, governance participation, and content moderation on the DCN platform. By leveraging funds from user-run boosts and ensuring a transparent, community-driven process, DCN can foster a vibrant and thriving decentralized social network.
